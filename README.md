### Visualizing Data with Leaflet

### Objective
Visualize an earthquake dataset from the USGS using Leaflet to create a map that plots all earthquakes in the past month based on their longitude and latitude.
<br><br>

### Level 1 : Basic Visualization
- Earthquakes with higher magnitudes will appear larger and earthquakes with greather depth will appear darker in color.
- Clicking on the earthquake markers will popup additional information regarding location, magnitude, depth, and time of earthquake.
- A legend in included in the bottom right to provide context for the map.

<br><br>

### Level 2 : More Data
Plot a second data set on your map to illustrate the relationship between tectonic plates and seismic activity.
- Add multiple base maps to choose from (satellite, dark).
- Separate out the seismic activity and tectonic plates datasets to be able to toggle between them independently.
- Toggle between the base maps and datasets through the use of a layer control
