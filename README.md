### Visualizing Data with Leaflet

### Objective
Visualize an earthquake dataset from the USGS using Leaflet to create a map that plots all earthquakes in the past month based on their longitude and latitude.
<br>
Earthquakes with higher magnitudes will appear larger and earthquakes with greather depth will appear darker in color.
<br>
Clicking on the earthquake markers will popup additional information regarding location, magnitude, depth, and time of earthquake.
